 <h1>NID based Anti-corruption tool</h1>
   <p>
        <strong>Introduction: </strong>To identify the corrupted person here I tried to use the NID. As we all know almost everything in Bangladesh Connected to NID like Bank, land-properties, Tax etc. 
so I tried to connect all the possible transactions system to find out the current properties, income and expense to analyze the person is corrupted or not
